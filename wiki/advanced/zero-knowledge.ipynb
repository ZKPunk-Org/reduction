    "# Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-knowledge proofs are interactive protocols where a prover convinces a verifier that a statement is true, while revealing nothing beyond the validity of the statement itself. This is a powerful application of the simulation paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "**Reference**: Based on Section 5 of \"How To Simulate It\" by Yehuda Lindell (2016).\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Zero-Knowledge?\n",
    ":label: zk-intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **zero-knowledge proof**, we have:\n",
    "- A prover $P$ who knows a witness $w$ for a statement $x \\in L$\n",
    "- A verifier $V$ who wants to be convinced that $x \\in L$\n",
    "- The requirement that $V$ learns **nothing** beyond the fact that $x \\in L$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Simulation Paradigm for Zero-Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that a protocol is zero-knowledge, we construct a simulator $\\mathcal{S}$ that:\n",
    "- Receives only the statement $x$ (but NOT the witness $w$)\n",
    "- Generates a transcript that is indistinguishable from a real interaction between $P(x,w)$ and $V(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "If such a simulator exists, it proves that the verifier learns nothing from the interaction, since the same transcript could be generated without the witness.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important} Key Challenge\n",
    "Unlike in semantic security, the zero-knowledge simulator must produce a convincing transcript without knowing the witness $w$. This typically requires **rewinding** the verifier to extract randomness or adjust the simulation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Zero-Knowledge Definition\n",
    ":label: zk-definition\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Definition: Zero-Knowledge\n",
    "Let $(P, V)$ be an interactive proof system for a language $L$. We say that $(P, V)$ is **zero-knowledge** if for every probabilistic polynomial-time verifier $V^*$ there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time simulator $\\mathcal{S}$ such that for every $x \\in L$ and every witness $w$ for $x$:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important observations**:\n",
    "- The simulator $\\mathcal{S}$ gets only the statement $x$, not the witness $w$\n",
    "- This must hold for **every** polynomial-time verifier $V^*$, not just the honest verifier\n",

    "## Example: Graph 3-Coloring\n",
    ":label: graph-3-coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the classic zero-knowledge protocols proves knowledge of a 3-coloring of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: A graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices\n",
    "- **Witness**: A valid 3-coloring $\\phi: V \\rightarrow \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ such that for all $(u,v) \\in E$, $\\phi(u) \\neq \\phi(v)$\n",
    "- **Goal**: Prove knowledge of $\\phi$ without revealing any information about the coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol 5.3: Zero-Knowledge for Graph 3-Coloring\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{dropdown} **The Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common input**: Graph $G = (V,E)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prover's witness**: Valid 3-coloring $\\phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repeat the following $n|E|$ times**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prover commits**:\n",
    "   - Choose a random permutation $\\pi$ of $\\{1,2,3\\}$\n",
    "   - For each vertex $v \\in V$, commit to $\\pi(\\phi(v))$ using a commitment scheme\n",
    "   - Send all $n$ commitments to the verifier\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verifier challenges**:\n",
    "   - Choose a random edge $(u,v) \\in E$\n",
    "   - Send $(u,v)$ to the prover\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prover responds**:\n",
    "   - Decommit to the colors of vertices $u$ and $v$ (i.e., reveal $\\pi(\\phi(u))$ and $\\pi(\\phi(v))$)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verifier checks**:\n",
    "   - Verify that the decommitments are valid\n",
    "   - Verify that $\\pi(\\phi(u)) \\neq \\pi(\\phi(v))$\n",
    "   - Accept if all checks pass\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This is Zero-Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{dropdown} **Simulator Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator $\\mathcal{S}$ for the honest verifier works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without knowing the coloring $\\phi$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a random edge $(u,v) \\in E$ (predicting the verifier's challenge)\n",
    "2. Choose two random different colors $c_1, c_2 \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ with $c_1 \\neq c_2$\n",
    "3. Commit to $c_1$ for vertex $u$ and $c_2$ for vertex $v$\n",
    "4. For all other vertices, commit to random colors\n",
    "5. When the verifier sends challenge $(u',v')$:\n",
    "   - If $(u',v') = (u,v)$: proceed with decommitment (colors are already different)\n",
    "   - If $(u',v') \\neq (u,v)$: **rewind** the verifier and try again from step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "- The simulator guesses correctly with probability $1/|E|$\n",
    "- Expected number of rewinds: $|E|$ (polynomial)\n",
    "- The simulated transcript is identically distributed to a real execution\n",
    "- Therefore: $\\text{VIEW}_{V}[P(G,\\phi) \\leftrightarrow V(G)] \\equiv \\mathcal{S}(G)$\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Rewinding Technique\n",
    ":label: rewinding\n",
    "\n",
    "The key technique in zero-knowledge simulation is **rewinding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Rewinding Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The simulator runs the verifier and commits to some values\n",
    "2. The simulator receives the verifier's challenge\n",
    "3. If the simulator cannot answer this challenge, it:\n",
    "   - **Rewinds** the verifier to before receiving the challenge\n",
    "   - Tries again with a different commitment\n",
    "4. Repeat until finding a commitment that allows answering the challenge\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip} Key Insight\n",
    "Rewinding is possible in the simulation because the simulator controls the verifier's execution. In a real protocol, the prover cannot rewind the verifier, which is why the prover needs the actual witness to answer any challenge.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements for Rewinding\n",
    "\n",
    "For rewinding to be efficient:\n",
    "- The probability of successfully answering a random challenge must be non-negligible\n",
    "- The verifier's random choices must be independent across rewinds\n",
    "- The expected number of rewinds must be polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced: Non-Black-Box Simulation\n",
    ":label: non-black-box\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation technique described above is **black-box**: the simulator uses the verifier's code as a black box, rewinding it as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Black-Box Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Black-box simulation faces challenges with:\n",
    "- **Concurrent composition**: When multiple protocol instances run simultaneously, rewinding becomes problematic\n",
    "- **Auxiliary input**: If the verifier has auxiliary information correlated with the statement, simulation may fail\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Rewinding can make simulation inefficient in complex scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Black-Box Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-black-box simulation** uses the verifier's code directly (not as a black box):\n",
    "- The simulator can inspect the verifier's program\n",
    "- Can use techniques like **FLS (Feige-Lapidot-Shamir)** simulation\n",
    "- Enables stronger security properties like universal composability\n",

    "## Protocol: Goldreich-Kahan Zero-Knowledge\n",
    ":label: goldreich-kahan\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general construction for zero-knowledge proofs for all of NP.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Protocol 5.5: Zero-Knowledge for NP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common input**: Statement $x$ (claim that $x \\in L$ for an NP language $L$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prover's witness**: Witness $w$ such that $(x,w) \\in R_L$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduction to Graph 3-Coloring**:\n",
    "1. Reduce the NP statement to graph 3-coloring (using the Cook-Levin theorem)\n",
    "2. Run the graph 3-coloring zero-knowledge protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that **every NP language has a zero-knowledge proof system**.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of Zero-Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soundness vs. Zero-Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-knowledge protocols must balance two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Soundness**: A malicious prover without a witness cannot convince the verifier (except with negligible probability)\n",
    "2. **Zero-Knowledge**: An honest execution reveals nothing to the verifier beyond the statement's validity\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties are proven separately:\n",
    "- Soundness: Show that a cheating prover succeeds with negligible probability\n",
    "- Zero-knowledge: Construct a simulator that generates indistinguishable transcripts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Zero-Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perfect ZK**: Real and simulated views are identically distributed\n",
    "- **Statistical ZK**: Real and simulated views are statistically close\n",
    "- **Computational ZK**: Real and simulated views are computationally indistinguishable\n",
    "\n",
    "Most practical protocols achieve computational zero-knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Zero-Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-knowledge proofs are fundamental to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authentication**: Prove knowledge of a password without revealing it\n",
    "2. **Blockchain Privacy**: Prove transaction validity without revealing amounts (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs)\n",
    "3. **Secure Computation**: Component in MPC protocols\n",
    "4. **Anonymous Credentials**: Prove properties about credentials without revealing the credential itself\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important} Key Takeaway\n",
    "Zero-knowledge proofs demonstrate the power of simulation: by showing that a verifier's view can be simulated without the witness, we prove that the interaction reveals no information beyond the statement's validity. The rewinding technique is essential for constructing such simulators.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero-knowledge** means the verifier learns nothing beyond the statement's validity\n",
    "2. Proven via **simulation**: a simulator produces indistinguishable transcripts without the witness\n",
    "3. **Rewinding** is the key technique allowing simulators to handle verifier challenges\n",
    "4. **Graph 3-coloring** demonstrates the core ideas with commitment and challenge-response\n",
    "5. Every **NP language** has a zero-knowledge proof (via reduction to 3-coloring)\n",
    "6. Zero-knowledge has numerous applications in modern cryptography and privacy-preserving protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation paradigm transforms zero-knowledge from an intuitive privacy notion into a rigorously provable cryptographic property.\n"
