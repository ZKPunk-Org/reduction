    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook has two primary goals.\n",
    "First, it aims to provide sufficient background to understand state-of-the-art papers on cryptographic signatures, with a focus on discrete-logarithm-based multi-party signatures, including their security proofs.\n",
    "Second, it seeks to develop the skills needed to formalize security notions for cryptographic primitives.\n",
    "This skill is crucial for selecting appropriate primitives when proposing and reviewing cryptographic protocols, and for defining precisely what a protocol aims to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts introduced in this section may at first seem abstract, but this level of abstraction is important: it provides the rigorous mathematical framework on which modern provable cryptography is built.\n",
    "Throughout this workbook we will study algorithms, analyse their running time and success probability, both for explicit algorithms and for hypothetical adversarial algorithms.\n",
    "In later sections we will sometimes study these algorithms within idealised computational models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook primarily contains definitions, propositions, and lemmas, with limited intuitive explanations.\n",
    "Good cryptography papers should include intuition, but it's never complete: intuition is inherently subjective and what makes sense to one reader may not resonate with another.\n",
    "What you need to do is develop your own explanations while reading the mathematics very precisely.\n",
    "The goal of this workbook is to build intuition step-by-step through the exercises, which provide hands-on experience with the theoretical concepts.\n",
    "Some of the most illuminating moments come when we examine how security proofs break after making seemingly minor changes to either the security definition or the cryptographic scheme; these failures reveal the precise assumptions and techniques that make the proofs work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is rarely a single standard definition for a concept in cryptography.\n",
    "Sometimes we encounter equivalent definitions in the literature, while other times we find definitions that differ in subtle but important ways.\n",
    "This is why contemporary papers in cryptography include a preliminaries section that rigorously defines the concepts they use."
