    "# Oblivious Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive in which a sender transfers one of several pieces of information to a receiver, but remains oblivious as to which piece has been transferred. This is a cornerstone of secure two-party computation.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "**Reference**: Based on Sections 8-9 of \"How To Simulate It\" by Yehuda Lindell (2016).\n",

    "## What is Oblivious Transfer?\n",
    ":label: ot-intro\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "In **1-out-of-2 OT**, denoted $OT_2^1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sender's input**: Two strings $(s_0, s_1)$\n",
    "- **Receiver's input**: A choice bit $\\sigma \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "- **Receiver's output**: $s_\\sigma$ (the string corresponding to its choice)\n",
    "- **Sender's output**: Nothing (remains oblivious to $\\sigma$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Receiver privacy**: The sender learns nothing about $\\sigma$\n",
    "2. **Sender privacy**: The receiver learns nothing about $s_{1-\\sigma}$ (the string not chosen)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Ideal Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal $\\mathcal{F}_{OT}$ functionality:\n",
    "1. Receives $(s_0, s_1)$ from the sender\n",
    "2. Receives $\\sigma$ from the receiver\n",
    "3. Sends $s_\\sigma$ to the receiver\n",
    "4. Sends nothing to the sender\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Oblivious Transfer is Important\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important} Fundamental Result\n",
    "Oblivious Transfer is **complete for secure two-party computation**: any two-party functionality can be securely computed given access to OT (along with commitments and zero-knowledge proofs).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes OT one of the most important primitives in cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protocol 8.2: Oblivious Transfer (Semi-Honest)\n",
    ":label: ot-protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a protocol based on the DDH assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{dropdown} **Protocol: 1-out-of-2 OT**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public parameters**: Cyclic group $\\mathbb{G}$ of prime order $q$ with generator $g$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sender input**: $(s_0, s_1) \\in \\{0,1\\}^n \\times \\{0,1\\}^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Receiver input**: $\\sigma \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Protocol**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Receiver prepares public keys**:\n",
    "   - Choose random $r \\leftarrow \\mathbb{Z}_q$\n",
    "   - If $\\sigma = 0$: Set $pk_0 = g^r$ and $pk_1 = h$ (random element)\n",
    "   - If $\\sigma = 1$: Set $pk_0 = h$ (random element) and $pk_1 = g^r$\n",
    "   - Send $(pk_0, pk_1)$ to sender\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sender encrypts both strings**:\n",
    "   - Choose random $s \\leftarrow \\mathbb{Z}_q$\n",
    "   - Compute $c_0 = (g^s, pk_0^s \\cdot H(g^s) \\oplus s_0)$\n",
    "   - Compute $c_1 = (g^s, pk_1^s \\cdot H(g^s) \\oplus s_1)$\n",
    "   - Send $(c_0, c_1)$ to receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Receiver decrypts**:\n",
    "   - Parse $c_\\sigma = (\\alpha, \\beta)$\n",
    "   - Compute $s_\\sigma = \\beta \\oplus H(\\alpha^r)$\n",
    "   - Output $s_\\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correctness**:\n",
    "- If $\\sigma = 0$: $\\alpha^r = (g^s)^r = (pk_0)^s$, so decryption recovers $s_0$\n",
    "- If $\\sigma = 1$: $\\alpha^r = (g^s)^r = (pk_1)^s$, so decryption recovers $s_1$\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Receiver privacy**: Under DDH, $(g, g^r, h, h^r)$ is indistinguishable from $(g, g^r, h, R)$ where $R$ is random. So the sender cannot tell which of $pk_0, pk_1$ corresponds to $g^r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sender privacy**: The receiver can only decrypt $c_\\sigma$ (because it only knows the discrete log of $pk_\\sigma$). The other ciphertext $c_{1-\\sigma}$ is semantically secure.\n",

    "## Simulation for Corrupted Sender\n",
    ":label: sim-sender\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sender is corrupted, the simulator must:\n",
    "1. **Extract** the sender's inputs $(s_0, s_1)$\n",
    "2. Generate a view for the sender that hides the receiver's choice $\\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{dropdown} **Simulator $\\mathcal{S}_S$ (Corrupted Sender)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Simulate the receiver's message without revealing $\\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation**:\n",
    "1. Choose random $r_0, r_1 \\leftarrow \\mathbb{Z}_q$\n",
    "2. Set $pk_0 = g^{r_0}$ and $pk_1 = g^{r_1}$ (both are valid public keys)\n",
    "3. Send $(pk_0, pk_1)$ to the adversarial sender $\\mathcal{A}_S$\n",
    "4. Receive $(c_0, c_1)$ from $\\mathcal{A}_S$\n",
    "5. **Extract**: Decrypt both ciphertexts using $r_0$ and $r_1$ to obtain $(s_0, s_1)$\n",
    "6. Send $(s_0, s_1)$ to the ideal functionality $\\mathcal{F}_{OT}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "- In the real protocol, one of $pk_0, pk_1$ is $g^r$ and the other is random\n",
    "- In the simulation, both are of the form $g^r$ (but the sender doesn't know which is which)\n",
    "- Under DDH, these distributions are computationally indistinguishable\n",
    "- The simulator successfully extracts both inputs and produces an indistinguishable view\n",

    "When the receiver is corrupted, the simulator must:\n",

    "**Challenge**: Must encrypt $s_{1-\\sigma}$ without knowing it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation**:\n",
    "1. Receive $(pk_0, pk_1)$ from adversarial receiver $\\mathcal{A}_R$\n",
    "2. **Extract $\\sigma$**: Check which of $pk_0, pk_1$ the adversary knows the discrete log for\n",
    "   - This requires checking if $\\mathcal{A}_R$ can decrypt trial encryptions\n",
    "   - Or use the discrete log relation to determine which is $g^r$\n",
    "3. Send $\\sigma$ to ideal functionality and receive $s_\\sigma$\n",
    "4. Encrypt $s_\\sigma$ under $pk_\\sigma$ as in the real protocol\n",
    "5. Encrypt a **random string** under $pk_{1-\\sigma}$ (since receiver cannot decrypt it)\n",
    "6. Send $(c_0, c_1)$ to $\\mathcal{A}_R$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "- The encryption under $pk_{1-\\sigma}$ is semantically secure (receiver doesn't have the secret key)\n",

    "## The Extraction Challenge\n",
    ":label: extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge in simulating the corrupted receiver is **extracting the choice bit $\\sigma$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Extraction is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator must:\n",
    "- Determine what input the adversarial receiver is using\n",
    "- Send this input to the ideal functionality\n",
    "- Receive back the corresponding output\n",
    "\n",
    "Without extraction, the simulator cannot determine which value the adversary should receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extraction Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches for extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete log extraction**: If the receiver's message reveals information about which $pk$ it knows the discrete log of\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trapdoor extraction**: Use a trapdoor in the public parameters to extract the adversary's choice\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Require the receiver to prove knowledge of the discrete log of exactly one of $pk_0, pk_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Reference String (CRS) Model\n",
    ":label: crs-model\n",
    "\n",
    "Many protocols achieve security by using a **Common Reference String**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the CRS Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CRS model:\n",
    "- Before the protocol starts, a trusted party generates public parameters (the CRS)\n",
    "- All parties have access to this CRS\n",
    "- The CRS is generated once and used for multiple protocol executions\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRS vs. Plain Model\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Plain Model | CRS Model |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| Setup | None | Trusted setup generates CRS |\n",
    "| Security | Harder to achieve | Enables stronger protocols |\n",
    "| Examples | Coin tossing (semi-honest) | UC-secure protocols, NIZKs |\n",
    "| Simulation | Often requires rewinding | Trapdoor in CRS aids simulation |\n",

    "### Protocol 9.1: OT in the CRS Model\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Enhanced OT Protocol with CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Reference String**: $(g, h = g^\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha$ is unknown to all parties\n",
    "\n",
    "**For simulation**: The simulator knows the trapdoor $\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modified Protocol**:\n",
    "- Receiver sends $(pk_0, pk_1)$ along with a proof that it knows the discrete log of exactly one\n",
    "- The CRS enables more efficient proofs and extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: The simulator can use $\\alpha$ to extract the receiver's choice more efficiently\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why CRS Helps Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trapdoor extraction**: The simulator can use the CRS trapdoor to extract adversary inputs without rewinding\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-interactive proofs**: Enables NIZKs (Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge proofs)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Straight-line simulation**: No need for rewinding, which is important for concurrent security\n",
