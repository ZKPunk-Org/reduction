    "# Coin Tossing Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin tossing is a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two mutually distrusting parties wish to generate a random bit (or string) such that neither party can bias the outcome. This is a key building block for secure computation protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "**Reference**: Based on Section 7 of \"How To Simulate It\" by Yehuda Lindell (2016).\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Coin Tossing Problem\n",
    ":label: coin-tossing-problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Informal Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Two parties, $P_1$ and $P_2$, wish to jointly generate a random bit $b \\in \\{0,1\\}$ such that:\n",
    "- Neither party can bias the outcome (except with negligible probability)\n",
    "- The outcome is truly random if at least one party is honest\n",
    "- Both parties learn the outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Ideal Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **ideal world**, there is a trusted party $\\mathcal{T}$ that:\n",
    "1. Receives input from both $P_1$ and $P_2$ (no actual input needed, just notification)\n",
    "2. Chooses a uniformly random bit $b \\leftarrow \\{0,1\\}$\n",
    "3. Sends $b$ to both parties\n",
    "\n",
    "A secure coin tossing protocol must emulate this ideal functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protocol 7.1: Single Bit Coin Tossing\n",
    ":label: single-bit-protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a simple protocol for tossing a single coin between two parties.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{dropdown} **Protocol: Coin Tossing (Single Bit)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**: None (both parties just want a random bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Protocol**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **$P_1$ commits**:\n",
    "   - Choose random $r_1 \\leftarrow \\{0,1\\}$\n",
    "   - Compute commitment $c = \\text{Com}(r_1)$ using a commitment scheme\n",
    "   - Send $c$ to $P_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **$P_2$ sends random bit**:\n",
    "   - Choose random $r_2 \\leftarrow \\{0,1\\}$\n",
    "   - Send $r_2$ to $P_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **$P_1$ decommits**:\n",
    "   - Send $r_1$ and decommitment information to $P_2$\n",
    "   - $P_2$ verifies the decommitment\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Both compute output**:\n",
    "   - Output $b = r_1 \\oplus r_2$\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**:\n",
    "- $P_1$ cannot change $r_1$ after seeing $r_2$ (due to commitment binding)\n",
    "- $P_2$ cannot predict $r_1$ when choosing $r_2$ (due to commitment hiding)\n",
    "- The XOR ensures that if either bit is random, the output is random\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal analysis**:\n",
    "- If $P_1$ is honest: $r_1$ is truly random and independent of $r_2$, so $b = r_1 \\oplus r_2$ is uniformly random\n",
    "- If $P_2$ is honest: $r_2$ is chosen without knowledge of $r_1$ (by hiding), so $b$ is uniformly random\n",
    "- If both are honest: $b$ is obviously uniformly random\n",
    "\n",

    "### Simulating a Corrupted $P_1$\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{dropdown} **Simulator for Corrupted $P_1$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulator $\\mathcal{S}_1$** (when $P_1$ is corrupted):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Receive ideal output $b$ from the trusted party\n",
    "2. Receive commitment $c$ from the adversarial $P_1^*$\n",
    "3. **Extract**: Use the commitment's extractability to extract $r_1$ from $c$\n",
    "   - (Note: For semi-honest security, we can just observe what $P_1^*$ sends later)\n",
    "4. **Compute**: Set $r_2 = b \\oplus r_1$ (this ensures the final output will be $b$)\n",
    "5. Send $r_2$ to $P_1^*$\n",
    "6. Output whatever $P_1^*$ outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "- In the real protocol, $r_2$ is uniformly random\n",
    "- In the simulation, $r_2 = b \\oplus r_1$ where $b$ is uniformly random\n",
    "- Since $b$ is random and independent of $r_1$, the value $r_2 = b \\oplus r_1$ is also uniformly random\n",

    "## The Hybrid Model\n",
    ":label: hybrid-model\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin tossing protocols are often analyzed in the **hybrid model**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Hybrid Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the hybrid model, the protocol has access to some ideal functionalities as subroutines. For coin tossing:\n",
    "- We assume an ideal **commitment functionality** $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{com}}$\n",
    "- Parties can commit and decommit by sending messages to $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{com}}$\n",
    "- The functionality guarantees binding and hiding properties perfectly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security in the Hybrid Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We prove:\n",
    "1. **Coin tossing protocol is secure** in the $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{com}}$-hybrid model\n",
    "2. **Commitment protocol is secure** (instantiates $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{com}}$)\n",
    "3. By **composition theorem**: The combined protocol is secure\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach simplifies security proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Against Malicious Adversaries\n",
    ":label: malicious-security\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol above is secure against **semi-honest** adversaries. What about **malicious** adversaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attacks by Malicious Adversaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A malicious $P_1^*$ could:\n",
    "- Commit to $r_1$, see $r_2$, then refuse to decommit if the outcome is unfavorable\n",
    "- This allows $P_1^*$ to abort if $r_1 \\oplus r_2$ is not the desired value\n",
    "\n",
    "A malicious $P_2^*$ could:\n",
    "- In a sequential composition setting, use the commitment $c$ from one session in another session (\"commitment reuse attack\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing Malicious Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve security against malicious adversaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gradual release**: Instead of $P_1$ decommitting all at once, use a gradual release protocol where both parties release bits of their randomness in alternation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Penalties for abort**: Use a protocol where aborting is detectable and punishable\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Have parties prove they are following the protocol correctly\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip} Important Note\n",
    "Achieving **fair** coin tossing against malicious adversaries (where neither party can bias the outcome even by aborting) is actually impossible without additional assumptions like a common reference string or computational hardness assumptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Coin tossing presents unique simulation challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Output Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in zero-knowledge (where the statement is fixed), in coin tossing:\n",
    "- The output is **random** and determined by the protocol interaction\n",
    "- The simulator must produce a specific output (from the ideal functionality)\n",
    "- But it must do so in a way that looks natural given the adversary's randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Programming the Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator \"programs\" the protocol to produce the desired output:\n",
    "- Simulator receives ideal output $b$ from trusted party\n",
    "- Simulator observes or extracts the adversary's random choice\n",
    "- Simulator sets its own random choice to force the output to be $b$\n",
    "- This works because the XOR allows \"programming\" the result\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Coin Tossing\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin tossing is used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Secure Computation**: Generating shared randomness for MPC protocols\n",
    "2. **Leader Election**: Choosing a random party to perform some task\n",
    "3. **Sampling**: Jointly sampling from complex distributions\n",
    "4. **Contract Signing**: Fair exchange protocols\n",
    "5. **Gambling Protocols**: Ensuring fairness in online gambling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coin tossing** allows two parties to generate shared randomness without trusting each other\n",
    "2. The basic protocol uses **commitment + XOR**: one party commits, the other sends random bits, then XOR determines the output\n",
    "3. **Simulation** works by \"programming\" the output: the simulator sets its random choice to force the desired result\n",
    "4. The **hybrid model** simplifies analysis by assuming ideal commitment functionality\n",
    "5. **Semi-honest security** is achievable with simple protocols, but **malicious security** requires additional techniques\n",
    "6. **Fair coin tossing** (where malicious parties cannot bias even by aborting) requires stronger assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin tossing demonstrates how simulation proofs handle protocols with random outputs, a key technique for analyzing secure computation protocols.\n"
